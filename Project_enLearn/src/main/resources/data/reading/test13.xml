        Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.

    <question>
        Her _________ began to fade when she returned to the Sorbonne to succeed her husband.
    </question>
    <answers>
        misfortune
        anger
        wretchedness
        disappointment
        ambition
    </answers>
    <correctAnswer>
        wretchedness
    </correctAnswer>
    <explanation>
        The closest synonym for the “feeling of desolation” (despair) described in the passage is wretchedness. Misfortune (A) or ill fate/luck is not as close. Anger (B) is a separate emotion from desolation. Disappointment (D) is also different from desolation, meaning feeling let-down rather than hopeless. Ambition (E) is drive to succeed or accomplish things. It was not Curie’s ambition that faded upon returning to the Sorbonne but her depression.
