        Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.

        challenged authority
    </correctAnswer>
    <explanation>
        Marie challenged authority by going to study at the Sorbonne, because Warsaw’s university did not admit women. The passage indicates this challenge by describing her “defiantly” leaving Poland for France; i.e., she was defying authority. The passage does not indicate she showed intelligence (B), “behaved” (C), or was distressed (D) or upset by her move.
